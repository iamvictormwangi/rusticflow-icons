Its better to include rusticflow-icons through cdn.

It relies on grass and rusticflow to build.

They are both rust tools that can be easily be installed
 through `cargo install`

Example

```

cargo install grass

```

```

cargo install rusticflow

```

Usage with unpkg

```

<link rel="stylesheet" href="">

```
